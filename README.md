# SOAProjects

Simple webservice for University management. It was created in Java EE with JBoss Application Server and Postgresql.
Service allows to create students, professors and subjects and store their data in pgsql database. 
Project was developed as part of the Soa in the design and implementation of software.
We started with soap communication and then we developed it into rest. Still the soap part is included in repository.
Project contains webservice consumption(both soap and rest), database connection,JWT authorization, JAX-RS validation, possibility of creating documentation with Swagger and getting objects as Protocol Buffer.
